    <h1><center>Love</center></h1>
    <p><center> Love is a really fucking gay feeling and it sucks and is probably not real at all I fucking hate it you know do you get to know someone after a while you just gonna grow the fuck up is like man you know that all they don’t share any of that sort of feelings with you and it’s like a fucking drug man you know you get kind of addicted to someone and then and then realize it’s bad for you so then you just fucking with drawl like the whole fucking up-and-down process is fucking stupid and I’m tired of it now I’m fucking dealt with this sort of shit before another Waze man and it just seems like the things that I’ve learned to like man the worst things for the end of the ones that you know who dude do you like me I can’t stand and it’s like Man same goes for friends to outside of just sexual interests you know you’ve become friends with certain people and the ones that I know you would appreciate the most are probably the ones worse for you because I guess they just enable your awful behavior and then the ones that hold you accountable for you fucking hate it’s really fucking crazy how that works so sometimes I just I feel like you know having any sort of have a feeling towards anyone is it is it really that good of an idea event that you should just kind of look for yourself most of the time aside as that sounds you know I I feel like I become a lot happier when I’m just living living for me and for a littleLiterally no one else</center></p>
