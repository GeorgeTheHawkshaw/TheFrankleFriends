    <h1><center>Driving</center></h1>
    <p><center> so this documents about driving in Lou of this I’m going to be driving that way so basically driving to me man is very therapeutic and kind of kind of takes my mind off of things and gets me I don’t know what it is it’s just maybe that the freedom just have a ability to go places and just be alone with your own thoughts I guess that’s really the best sort of meditation you know I have a hard time at home I don’t really like my home life and I kind of just the car is the escape you know being able to hit the road and just fly away for a while is this is exciting to me and I feel like I can really clear my thoughts while while in the car or at least by walking in our and I don’t really know maybe it’s the action of movement or having some sort of set destination that really distracts me from the things that are get me down you know where I’m able to have these conversations by myself in a private setting and nobody has to know so you know I don’t I drive around I discovered this this product that this process this is actually one of the ways that I can figure out how would I want to do for for school projects and how I find my inspiration as I drive it I kind of ramble to myself for a little while but I try to fucking go through those thoughts no it’s really cool and you know I come up with some really neat ideas that have some really neat moments of introspection it out and I’m doing itHere without any sort of drugs or therapy or anything like that and another our marriage therapy don’t give me wrong I mean I’ve definitely done it and I definitely need to go back that’s that’s just a whole Nother thing but yeah man I’m in the the driving just just texted the mind away it makes me feel free and a lot of the times I don’t feel free I feel just really hung up and I don’t like it you know I just wanna go away and live the men men just see people all and see what’s going on out there you know it’s it’s my escape that’s what I do it’s you know I’d I don’t necessarily like working on cars it’s huge pain in the ass I gave that to a leg at some point but idk I came to don’t get me wrong I like the the ability to do work you’re proud of that work once once you’re done that’s really cool but having said yeah now my back hurts a lot I have to doing that so I don’t really like it that much and so you know I just stash I’d rather just drive away head west and the setting sun is as I always say it and just and just see what there is to see that’s how I then that’s how I figure out shit and it’s support to me that the car is the place I figure myself out</center></p>
