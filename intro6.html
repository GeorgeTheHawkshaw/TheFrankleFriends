    <p><center>Everybody loses a concept that that me and Harold came up with a few years back and it’s it’s a philosophical concepts in that we kind of jokingly say everybody loses nobody wins and once you realize that everybody loses them that you can start carving double edge sword and that the it’s very it sounds very bleak it’s a very bleak thing everybody loses you can’t win but at the same time it kind of puts everything in perspective of like why even try so hard you’re gonna lose anyways so just fucking live it’s pure nihilism minutes beautiful and threw in respect of introspection for a previous project I think I came up with a pretty interesting interesting concept and that you know if a lemon you know if a lemon does a lemon dream sour dreams and I had that if a lemon was with the kids and human sentience in the human understanding of the world and probably pick up smoking did they deal with that all of that addiction and you know these disorder vices are just a nightly human you know an animal doesn’t realize it’s doing something stupid but but a human has the power to and so that’s why you’ve already if you’re able to think you’ve already lost if you’re able to contemplate losing you’ve lost</center></p>
