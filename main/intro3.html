    <p><center>So I basically have a drawer of shame it's my drawer near my bed and then that used to not be that way it used to just going to be in for like every other one but that's for, started storing all the stuff that I have grown to dislike on the Cannes remind me of a time where I was kind of more screwed up than I am now you know that's Rall my empty cigarette carton is going to die in my jewel pods and Vape's and my and other drugs and other things and that's where it just kind of goes just to be out of sight out of mine and it's it's kind of like I don't like looking at it to get to the inoculant right but but the drawer open and it's just a drawer it's just got shit in it it's just the shit I'm not too happy about that's the stuff that's collect their collected their stuff that I guess my mistakes it's my mistake for her and I stuff in there kind of is a collection of stuff and of course my dad comes to the side of the house to wash his face or whatever while I'm doing that so now I'm opening up and back for some reason not like that I didn't like the guy he just a course it's just exactly how that sort of shit works out you know now you just you just try to have this private moment everybody's everywhere and it's great and that's why I wanna be out of this joint so fast man yeah maybe it's because my God this place makes me so angry and maybe it's just because I want to see her body and my mistakes better and that sometimes I just like being alone I don't like being here and in this room surrounded by Juarez and that it just reminds me of you know what I could've been or any of that sort of shit and I know it just really distracts me from the present really distract me from future and in future goals and it really gets me down this is just not a good place for me to be and I just recently turned 20 and and for the past couple days I've been really blue for some reason I don't know if I'm just coming down other realizations and just not at night just kind of wanting to break out of the routine of things and not being stuck in the stupid stupid state where you can't even go outside and go just to shit every once in a while you just get fucking fed up because all you want to do is just go away for a while at least that's all I wanna do just wanna go away I am just try to ignore the things that are getting me down and then I'll go somewhere new and then and just live and just exist and I don't want to be here in this household anymore and I was in my drawer in my room this house every everyone here in this weird state where I don't really wanna have anything to do with my family anymore or anything like that it's just been kind of weird for me</center></p>
